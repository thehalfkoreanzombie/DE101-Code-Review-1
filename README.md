# My First Code Review

## Alex Wallace

## Description
For this project, I was tasked with creating a list containing an integer, a float, and a string. Then, I had to create a dictionary of puppies with 3 different keys and 3 different values. I then had to print out a list of the keys only by running the code. This was a success

## Setup/Installation Requirements
In order to set this up, you will need to make a directory for your file and then switch over to that directory. Then, create a virtual environment for python 3 to work in. Finally, run an installation of the requirements.txt file using pip and change into your virtual environment using source. Voila, you're all set up to use, alter and extend this code line!

## Known Bugs
The only possible bug I found in this code was at line 8. In a previous lesson, it was said that using puppies.keys() alone would print the keys for the dictionary. However, when I ran the code, the keys were not present in the result (even though there was no error and the code ran fine). I circumvented this by printing the puppies.keys() and that totally worked. This is either a bug, or a misunderstanding of how keys() works by me. I'm guessing the latter, as I can be dense at times.
